        <h1>Technical Report</h1>
        <h2>What is your element CSS class?</h2>
        <p>I only have one global CSS class, so the rest are element CSS classes: body, p, table, img, a, th, td </p>
        <h2>What is your global CSS class?</h2>
        <p> My global CSS class is id #header, which I refer to in my HTML file for my header.</p>
        <h2>What are your HTML5-only tags?</h2>
        <p>MY HTML5-only tags are the audio and video tags.</p>
        <h2>What are your CSS3-only features?</h2>
        <p>I used a text shadow in my header. I also used a font from www.1001freefonts.com (from powerpoint) to download a font called "Osaka Mustache" and 
            used @font-face at the top of my css file to refer to it in my header. 
        </p>
        <h2>Did you use the same protection method? If not, what did you use this time?</h2>
        <p>Yes, I kept the same one as lab 1. Instead of directing it to my lab01 page, I direct it to a contents page to links to all my completed labs.</p>
        <h2>How long did you spend on this lab?</h2>
        <p>I spent roughly 3 hours on this lab.</p>
