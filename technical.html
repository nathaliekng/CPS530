            <h2><strong>How did you password protect your page? </strong></h2>
            <p>My index.html page is set up as my password page, which 
                    has a button to prompt for password. It will then ask for a password and
                    keep asking until it is correct. Once correct, it will redirect to my main.html page
            </p>
            <h2><strong>What new tag did you try? What was its effect?</strong></h2>
            <p> I tried the &lt;table&gt; tag, which I have never used since I have never coded HTML. 
                    I also tried to use a couple font tags for example, the &lt;strong&gt; tag in my technical report and a couple colours 
                    on my main.html using style = "color: #"
            </p>
         
            <h2><strong>Does your page look different in different browsers and platforms?</strong></h2>
            <p>My page looks the same on all browsers and platforms.</p>
            <h2><strong>How long did you spend on this lab?</strong></h2>
            <p>I spent roughly 1-2 hours on this lab.</p>
